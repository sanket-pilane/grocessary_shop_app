# Grocery Shop Flutter App



Welcome to the Grocery Shop Flutter App! This simple grocery shopping app was created while learning Flutter. It serves as a great example of implementing essential Flutter concepts and state management using the Provider package. With this app, you can add products to your cart, view the list of items in your cart, and calculate the total amount for your shopping.

The app consists of three main screens:

1. **Onboarding Screen:** This screen provides an introduction to the app and helps users get familiar with its features.

2. **Homepage:** Here, users can browse a list of available products, add them to their shopping cart, and view product details.

3. **Cart:** In the cart screen, users can see a list of items they've added to their shopping cart and the total amount they need to pay.

## Features

- **Adding Products to Cart:** Users can select items from the homepage and add them to their cart.

- **Cart Management:** Users can view the items they've added to their cart, remove items, and see the total amount they need to pay.
